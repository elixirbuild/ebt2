# ebt2
EBT2 is a 2d game engine for a computer terminal. It is made completely with python. And what about EBT1? Well, that one failed so we're starting over, you can see it for yourself.

## NOTICE
This engine is currently in development so please do not expect it to work right now.

## What happened to ebt1?
EBT1 is the game engine before this one. And we stopped developing it, because it was a failiure and we didn't wan't to just fix it ourselves.

### Developers
- **Rogan Wido** - Gameplay Programming
- **OT Guzman** - Testing
